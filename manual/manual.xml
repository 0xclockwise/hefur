    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Hefur is a standalone and lightweight BitTorrent tracker written in C++.
    It does not depend on a database or anything complex to setup. Hefur keeps
    everything in memory which makes it very easy to run.</para>

    <para>It has not been designed to be an open tracker like opentracker.org, but
    fits perfectly for a small setup like a Linux distribution sharing its
    releases or a fansub team.</para>

    <para>The code is very simple so a neophyte could understand it and modify
    it for its specific needs.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Features</title>

    <title>Setup your own server</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Download and build Hefur</title>

      <para>Go to <ulink url="https://github.com/abique/hefur/downloads">
      https://github.com/abique/hefur/downloads</ulink> and download
      the last version.</para>

      <para>Then execute the following command:
      <programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="numbered"><![CDATA[
      tar xvf hefur-$version.tar.xz &&
      cd hefur-$version &&
      mkdir build &&
      cd build &&
      cmake .. &&
      make &&
      make install]]>
      </programlisting>

      If you like to disable the control interface and so hefurctl, run
      cmake with:
      <programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="numbered"><![CDATA[
      cmake -DHEFUR_CONTROL_INTERFACE=OFF ..]]>
      </programlisting>
      </para>

    <title>Options</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>The white list</title>

      <para>The white list is used defined the set of torrents which
      are tracked by the tracker. The way it works is pretty simple:
      you specify a path, and Hefur will periodically scan it recursively
      to find .torrent files and add them to the tracker. When a torrent
      file is removed from the torrent directory, then it will be removed
      from the white list.</para>

      <para>The white list is configured by the following options:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          -torrent-dir &lt;path&gt;
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          -scan-interval &lt;interval&gt; (interval is in minutes)
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Please ensure that the torrent directory is a finite tree.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Resources limits</title>

      <para>On most OS, the maximum number of opened files is 1024,
      which is probably enough. But if your tracker is going under
      heavy load, you might consider to increase its resources usage.</para>

      <para>To do so, I recommend you to read ulimit's manual and edit
      /etc/security/limits.conf.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>chroot, setuid and setgid</title>

      <para>If you're starting Hefur as root, you will see new options
      appears to help you dropping privileges:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          -chroot &lt;path&gt;
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          -uid &lt;uid&gt;|&lt;user name&gt;
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          -gid &lt;gid&gt;|&lt;group name&gt;
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>/stat and /peers pages</title>

      <para>These pages are not necessary for the smooth functioning
      of Hefur, they are just convenient to the user and administrator.</para>

      <para>The /stat page display collected statistics relative to the start
      time. Which means that every statistics are reset if you restart Hefur.
      </para>

      <para>There is no arm to let anyone access /stat and /peers, but if
      you want, you can disable them with
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          -disable-peers-page
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          -disable-stat-page
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Security considerations</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>The white list</title>

      <para>As you can own the directory scanned by Hefur, this is not
      really a big issue. But if you scan a network file system or simply
      a virtual file system which you don't control, this file system can
      arm Hefur by doing:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>an infinite tree</listitem>
        <listitem>an infinite .torrent file</listitem>
        <listitem>a high number of .torrent with crafted info part to put
        the torrent index in its worst case</listitem>
        <listitem>a high number of .torrent with crafted very long name
        to fill up memory</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      So if you scan an uncontrolled file system you want to:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>set the maximum .torrent file size: -max-torrent-size
        &lt;size in MiB&gt;</listitem>
        <listitem>truncate torrent's name longer than X:
        -max-torrent-name &lt;length&gt;</listitem>
        <listitem>limit the scan depth: -max-scan-depth &lt;depth&gt;</listitem>
        <listitem>limit the number of inodes scanned:
        -max-scan-inodes &lt;nb&gt;</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The number of peers per torrent</title>

      <para>This problem is very simple: you have an index for all the tracked
      peers, and you store peers. So it take memory. If you do not have an
      limit on the number of peers, you can exceed the available memory.</para>

      <para>Our solution is to limit the number of peers per torrent. If we
      exceed this limit, we simply pop the oldest peer, to push the new one.
      In fact it is safe as a tracker could only remember the 200 last peers,
      they'll be able to reach enough peers to achieve good download
      performances, and they'll all remain connected with PEX
      (Peer Exchange Protocol).</para>

      <para>You can use the following option to change the maximum number
      of peers per torrents:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          -max-peers &lt;nb&gt;
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The number of peers from the same IP</title>

      <para>As we index the IP address plus the port, a single machine
      could register many times to the tracker which is fine. But we don't
      want to let it registers too many times. We could try to use our index
      to do it, but as with ipv6, users can have a large number of distinct IP
      address it gets very complicated to find the right network mask. So
      the simple solution is to do nothing and just rely on the option:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>-max-peers &lt;nb&gt;</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Anyway, if someone is going to DDOS your tracker, it may come from a lot
      of different IPv4 and/or IPv6 address, so using network mask to protect
      the server is not a final solution.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Proxy considerations</title>

      <para>Hefur is usable through a proxy, but the referenced peer will
      be the proxy, not the peer itself. The peer will still be able to
      start downloading because it will gets a list of peers and be able
      to connect to them (as far as not every body is using a proxy).</para>

      <para>Why do we choose this behavior? Because we use the peer address
      to index peers and if we let a peer specify it, we let him spawn a lot
      of announces and then fill up our index.</para>

      <para>If you really want to allow peers to specify their address, you
      can use the option:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          -allow-proxy
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      I warn you to be sure that you set the option -max-peers to something
      reasonable if you use -allow-proxy.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Timeouts</title>

      <para>Hefur is pretty aggressive on timeouts. By default the peers has
      only 2 seconds to send its request, which is more than enough for a
      program. Through you can change this with the option:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          -http-timeout &lt;ms timeout&gt;
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>If you discover a hole</title>

      <para>Please report the issue to Alexandre Bique
      <email>bique.alexandre@gmail.com</email>. I'll do my best to fix it
      as soon as possible.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>HTTP, Chunked-Encoding and Keep-Alive</title>
      <para>As there are some BitTorrent client with pretty simple HTTP client,
      for /announce and /scrape, the Chunked-Encoding and Keep-Alive are
      disabled. But it is enabled for /stat and /peers.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>ip set to a DNS name in the HTTP announce request</title>
      <para>When you use -allow-proxy, the BitTorrent specification says that
      the peer can set ip to a DNS name in the HTTP announce request. We don't
      support that, as it requires to send the DNS name back to other peers, and
      a DNS name can be longuer than an ipv6 address. So to save memory we will
      just accept IPv4 and IPv6 coded address.</para>
